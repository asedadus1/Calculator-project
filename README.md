# Calculator-project


I'm excited to share my latest project - a calculator built using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. 
It's a simple tool that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, and I had a great
time designing and coding it. I hope you find it useful! #javascript #css #html #calculator #coding
